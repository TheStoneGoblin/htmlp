                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>Coffee addiction is extremely common nowadays. People from all paths of life can suffer from this. The problem is not the coffee consumption itself but rather the inability to purchase more. Students, for example, may not be able to afford coffee on top of all the other expenses in their lives.</p>

                <h2>The solution</h2>
                <p>As stated above, the problem lies in not being able to afford to purchase coffee. As such we at the CSS (Coffee Support Society) have made it our mission to help those struggling to buy their next cup. We offer a wide range of services, from 100% discounts on coffee in popular cafes such as Starbucks to supplying coffee beans completely for free.</p>

                <h2>How can you help?</h2>
                <p>As you can imagine, the services we supply aren't cheap, as such we would kindly ask all of those who can afford it, to donate to us. Even as little as a â‚¬5 donation can be enough to buy a poor student or a minimum wage factory employee a cup of nice hot java (pls don't sue us oracle). To donate, just click the link at the top of the page.</p>
