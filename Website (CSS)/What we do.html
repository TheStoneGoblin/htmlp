	<h2>Who we are</h2>
		<p>Coffee Support Society (CSS) is a small, not for profit organisation<br> 
		that is interested in funding mental health initiatives and other charities such as NCBI and so forth. <br>
		Through buying our coffee grinds and beans, you are able to support local coffee farmers in delivering quality coffee to your homes,<br> 
		free from chemicals and industrial grade pesticides that hamper the quality of your daily mug.
		</p>
	<h2>Stores</h2>
		<p>Currently we are a small business in Limerick, located in Arthur's Quay in the city center.
		However, we plan to expand to the rest of Ireland eventually through donations and helping other charity services.<br>
		At the moment we are located at <b>31 William Street Co. Limerick </b>.
		</p>
		<h2>Services</h2>
		<p>Coffee: <br>
		We offer Coffee in a variety of forms, such as ground, beans and instant from various companies
		Eg., Starbucks, Costa, etc.	The beans we sell are from ethically sourced coffee farms and plantations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Counselling: <br>
		In addition to our Coffee, we offer free counselling and mental health support with professional<br> 
		psychiatrists that we can redirect to you according to your personal budget.
		</p>
		<p>Also, given below is a video that summarizes why coffee is a healthy choice for you and your lifestyle.</p>
